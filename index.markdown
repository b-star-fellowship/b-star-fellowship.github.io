# What is B*?

B* is short for **Brown Startup Fellowship**; a 10 week summer program for Brown computer science students to build software products.

Every year, we give **$10,000** grants to 2 teams of student founders.  From **June 1 - August 15**, you'll live in Providence and build v1.0.0 of your software product.  By the end of the summer, you'll have something to launch to friends, family and random internet strangers.

If you and a friend are interested in our 2024 program, [please apply!](https://link.here)

# Who runs B*?

[Sam Dooman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-dooman-7463a2105/), was the 1st employee at [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com), and helped Down Dog blitz-scale to millions of users during the Covid-19 lockdowns.  Sam started this program because it's never been easier for smart, self-motivated people to start an internet business.

As a B* fellow, you'll have brief weekly calls with Sam for mentorship, or really anything.  These calls are totally optional; most of your learning will be by doing anyway.

# FAQ

#### How do I apply?

[Fill out this form!](https://link.here)

#### Are there any restrictions for my idea/team?
 - Product must be a software project; either a web app or mobile app or both.
 - Team must be 2 people; teams of 3 or more will move too slowly.
 - We generally bias towards students who have demonstrated they can build a big project, either in a class like CS32 or outside of class.

#### Why the name B*?

It's a cheeky reference to A*, the search algorithm.  Creating a software product from scratch requires conviction (heuristic), and lot of iteration (backtracking).

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
