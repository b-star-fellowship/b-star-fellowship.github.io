# What is B*?

B* is short for **Brown Startup Fellowship**; a 10 week summer fellowship for Brown University computer science students to build software products.

Every year, we give a **$10,000** grant to a team of student founders.  From **June 1 - August 15**, you'll build your product and launch it to friends, family and random internet strangers.

To get a sense for what kind of products you can build in B*, check out our fellows' work [here](/products).

# Who runs B*?

[Sam Dooman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-dooman-7463a2105/) was the 1st employee at [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com), and helped Down Dog blitz-scale to millions of users during the Covid-19 lockdowns.  As a B* fellow, you'll have access to Sam as a mentor via brief, weekly calls.

# FAQ

#### How do I apply?
[Apply to our 2025 summer fellowship here!](https://forms.gle/56rBUXt9oKoXS9mJ6)

#### Are there any restrictions for my idea/team?
 - Product must be a software project; a web app or mobile app.
 - Team must be 1-2 Brown university students, living in the same city, working on the project full time.
 - Students must have built a software project on a team before, either in a class like CS32 or outside of class.

#### Why the name B*?
It's a reference to A*, the graph search algorithm.  Creating a software product from scratch requires conviction you're building something useful (heuristic), and lot of iteration (backtracking).
