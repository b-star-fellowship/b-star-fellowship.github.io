# B\*: Build Something

B\* is the **Brown Startup Fellowship**; a 10 week summer fellowship for Brown University computer science students to build and launch software.

Every year, we give teams of student founders **$10,000** to build software.  From **June 1 - August 15**, B\* fellows build, iterate, test, and launch their products.

To get a sense for what kind of products you can build in B\*, check out our fellows' work [here](/products).

# FAQ

#### Who runs B\*?
[Sam Dooman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-dooman-7463a2105/) was the 1st employee at [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com), and helped Down Dog blitz-scale to millions of users during the Covid-19 lockdowns.  As a B\* fellow, you'll have access to Sam as a mentor via brief, weekly calls.

#### Are there any restrictions for my idea/team?
 - Product must be a software project; a web app, mobile app, command line tool, game, etc.
 - Team must be 1-2 Brown university students, living in the same city, working on the project full time.
