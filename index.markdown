# What is B*?

B* is short for **Brown Startup Fellowship**; a 10 week summer program for Brown computer science students to build software products.

Every year, we give **$10,000** grants to 2 teams of student founders.  From **June 1 - August 15**, you'll live in Providence and build v1.0.0 of your software product.  By the end of the summer, you'll have something to launch to friends, family and random internet strangers.

If you and a friend are interested in our 2024 program, [please apply!](https://forms.gle/CPwBHFqYcksibz658)

# Who runs B*?

[Sam Dooman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-dooman-7463a2105/) was the 1st employee at [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com), and helped Down Dog blitz-scale to millions of users during the Covid-19 lockdowns.  As a B* fellow, you'll have access to Sam as a mentor via brief, weekly calls.

#### Are there any restrictions for my idea/team?
 - Product must be a software project; a web app or mobile app.
 - Team must be 2 people
 - We bias towards students who have built a big project before, either in a class like CS32 or outside of class.

#### Why the name B*?

It's a reference to A*, the graph search algorithm.  Creating a software product from scratch requires conviction you're building the right thing (heuristic), and lot of iteration (backtracking).
