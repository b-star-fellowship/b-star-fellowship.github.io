# B\*: Build Something

B\* is the **Brown Startup Fellowship**; a 10 week summer fellowship for Brown University computer science students to build and launch software.

Every year, we give teams of student founders **$5,000 per person** to build software.  From **June 1 - August 15**, B\* fellows build, iterate, test, and launch their products.
