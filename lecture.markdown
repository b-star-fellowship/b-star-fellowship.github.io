# B* Software

## I'll pay you to build a product this summer!

**Brown Startup Fellowship**; a 10 week summer fellowship for Brown University computer science students to build consumer software products.

Every year, we give a **$10,000** grant to a team of two student founders.  From **June 1 - August 15**, you'll build v1 of your product and launch it to friends, family and random internet strangers.
