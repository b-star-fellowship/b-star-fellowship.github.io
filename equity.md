# Startup Equity Guide

An offer to work at a startup usually has 3 parts: Salary, Equity, and Benefits.  Equity means _ownership in the company_, either via stock or stock options.  Startups want their employees to own pieces of the company, so that employees are rewarded for their work & the company growing.  Importantly, the way that most people in tech get very wealthy is via their equity, not their salary.

Here are two real world examples from my own career to illustrate how you can value equity as part of your job offer.

## Example 1: My 2017 Down Dog offer (shares)
 - $100,000 yearly salary
 - 106,000 shares in the company, vesting over 4 years
 - Health insurance, food paid for at work

### 1. How much were 106,000 shares of Down Dog worth?
 - To compute this, we need to know A) how many shares are outstanding, and B) the current valuation of the company.
 - At the time of the offer, there were 5,088,000 shares outstanding, owned by other employees at the company.
 - At the time of the offer, the company valued themselves at $5,000,000 (with an implied price per share of $0.9827)

 - If I were issued 106,000 shares, my shares would amount to `106,000 / (106,000 + 5,088,000) => 0.02040816326`, or roughly 2% of the company.
 - 2% of a company valued at $5,000,000 equates to roughly $100,000.

### 2.  What is vesting?
 - Imagine I accepted the offer, immediately owned my 2% of the company, and then quit after a month.  That would be a disaster for Down Dog; they spent the equivalent of ~$100,000 for one month of work.

 - "Vesting" means those 106,000 shares are earned over time.  Vesting over 4 years means earning `106,000 / 4 => 26,500` shares per year.

 - Vesting schedules usually have a "1 year cliff": meaning I only earned my 26,500 shares after working at the company for a year, and after that start earning them normally.

 - A cliff protects the startup in the case where they hire an employee who doesn't work out, and the relationship sours.

### 3.  What's the total compensation?
 - 26,500 shares at the $5,000,000 valuation comes out to roughly $26,000 per year in ownership of the company.
 - Having meals paid for while at the office meant I was saving about ~$20 per work day, so `52 * 5 * 20 => $5,200` per year for food.
 - Salary + equity + food costs comes out to roughly $131,200 / year as total compensation.

### 4. How does company equity's value change over time?
 - Down Dog grew considerably from 2017 to 2018, and after 1 year my vested shares had approximately doubled in value to ~$52,000 (on paper).
 - If Down Dog had shrunk, or gone out of business, the paper value of my shares would have dropped or gone to zero.
 - When you get paid in equity vs salary, you're accepting more risk for more reward.

## Options vs Shares

When you earn shares, you have to pay taxes on them just like your salary.  That's not a problem for early stage companies, which the government values close to $0.

For later stage startups these taxes are problematic: they want employees to be incentivized to grow the company, but don't want to give their employees unneceessary tax burdens.  For example, imagine you pay $10,000 in taxes on 5,000 shares in a company that runs out of money and shuts down 1 year later.  Your shares are worthless, and you paid that tax for no reason!

The solution is to issue options instead of shares.  An option is a contract that will let you buy shares at a pre-described price.  While they help you defer taxes, stock options are slightly more complicated to value.

## Example 2: My 2021 Down Dog equity refresher (stock options):
 - As incentive to stay around longer, Down Dog offered me 46,370 stock options, vesting over another 4 years.
 - At the time of the offer, there were 5,495,506 shares outstanding, owned by employees at the company.
 - At the time of the offer, the company valued itself at $12,000,000 (with an implied price per share of $2.18)
 - That $2.18 is the exercise price of the options; once fully vested, I have the option to buy 46,370 shares in the company for `$2.18 * 46,370 => $101,086.60`

### 1. How much are those 46,370 stock options worth?
 - It depends on the price per share when you want to sell the shares.
 - Imagine Down Dog goes public, and the price per share is $4.00.  I could exercise the options for $2.18 and immediately sell the shares for $4 each to the public.
 - In that example, the options themselves are worth `($4.00 - $2.18) * 46,370 => $84,393.4`
 - Note: If the price per share goes below $2.18, the options are worthless.

### 2. What are shares/options worth if Down Dog doesn't go public?
 - A stock is worth what someone will pay you for it.  So if nobody can buy your shares, in practice they are worth $0.00.
 - Most startups fail, so the median startup's equity ends up being worth $0.00.

## Evaluating equity in your job offers
### 1. Ask the right questions
 - If your offer does not include equity, and you would like some, ask for some.  Many companies will let you trade off
   some of your salary for a bigger chunk of equity, if you're comfortable with the risk.

 - Make sure you have enough information to do the calculations I did above.  That means asking for the following:
    - How many outstanding shares are there?
    - What is the [409A valuation](https://carta.com/learn/startups/equity-management/409a-valuation/) of the company?
    - What is the strike price of my options?

 - Other important considerations:
    - How long do I have to exercise my options if I leave the company?
    - What is my vesting schedule?  Is there a cliff?
    - Is the company actively raising money (which would affect the number of outstanding shares), and if so how much @ what valuation?
    - What is the company's "runway" (how many months do they know there's enough money to fund operations).  A shorter runway means your
      equity is higher risk.

### 2. Value equity for yourself in your life stage
 - The right trade off between risk and reward is deeply personal, and different for everyone.
 - If you want to pay off student loans ASAP, or support your family in the short term, it's better to take salary over equity.
 - If you're down to gamble, with the slim possiblility of becoming wealthy, more equity is the way to go.
