# Startup Equity Guide

An offer to work at a startup usually has 3 parts: Salary, Equity, and Benefits.  Equity means _ownership in the company_, either via stock or stock options.  Startups want their employees to own pieces of the company, so that employees are rewarded for their work & the company growing.

Here are two real world examples from my own career to illustrate how you can value equity as part of your job offer.

## Example 1: My 2017 Down Dog offer (shares)
 - $100,000 yearly salary
 - 106,000 shares in the company, vesting over 4 years
 - Health insurance, food paid for at work

### 1. How much were 106,000 shares of Down Dog worth?
 - To compute this, we need to know A) how many shares are outstanding, and B) the current valuation of the company.
 - At the time of the offer, there were 5,088,000 shares outstanding, owned by other employees at the company.
 - At the time of the offer, the company valued themselves at $5,000,000 (with an implied price per share of $0.9827)

 - If I were issued 106,000 shares, my shares would amount to `106,000 / (106,000 + 5,088,000) => 0.02040816326`, or roughly 2% of the company.
 - 2% of a company valued at $5,000,000 equates to roughly $100,000.

### 2.  What is vesting?
 - Imagine I accepted the offer, immediately owned my 2% of the company, and then quit after a month.  That would be a disaster for Down Dog; they spent the equivalent of ~$100,000 for one month of work.

 - "Vesting" means those 106,000 shares are earned over time.  Vesting over 4 years means earning `106,000 / 4 => 26,500` shares per year.

 - Vesting schedules usually have a "1 year cliff": meaning I only earned my 26,500 shares after working at the company for a year, and after that start earning them normally.

 - A cliff protects the startup in the case where they hire an employee who doesn't work out, and the relationship sours.

### 3.  What's the total compensation?
 - 26,500 shares comes out to roughly $26,000 per year in ownership of the company
 - Having meals paid for while at the office meant I was saving about ~$30 per work day, so `52 * 5 * 30 => $7,800` per year for food.
 - Salary + equity + food costs comes out to roughly $133,800 as total compensation.


## Options vs Shares

When you earn shares, you have to pay taxes on them just like your salary.  That's not a problem for early stage companies, which the government values close to $0.

For later stage startups these taxes are problematic: they want employees to be incentivized by the company growing, but don't want to give their employees unneceessary tax burdens.  For example, imagine you pay $10,000 in taxes on 5,000 shares in a company that runs out of money and shuts down 3 years later.  Your shares are worthless, and you paid that tax for no reason!

The solution is to issue options instead of shares.  An option is a contract that will let you buy shares at a pre-described price.  While they help you defer taxes, stock options are slightly more complicated to value.

## Example 2: My 2021 Down Dog equity refresher (stock options):
 - As incentive to stay around longer, Down Dog offered me 46,370 stock options, vesting over another 4 years.
 - At the time of the offer, there were 5,495,506 shares outstanding, owned by employees at the company.
 - At the time of the offer, the company valued itself at $12,000,000 (with an implied price per share of $2.18)
 - That $2.18 is the exercise price of the options; once fully vested, I have the option to buy 46,370 shares in the company for `$2.18 * 46,370 => $101,086.60`

### 1. How much are those 46,370 stock options worth?
 - It depends on the price per share when you want to sell the shares.
 - Imagine Down Dog goes public, and the price per share is $4.00.  I could exercise the options for $2.18 and immediately sell the shares for $4 each to the public.
 - In that example, the options themselves are worth `($4.00 - $2.18) * 46,370 => $84,393.4`
 - Note: If the price per share goes below $2.18, the options are worthless.

### 2. What are shares/options worth if Down Dog doesn't go public?
 - A stock is worth what someone will pay you for it.  So if nobody can buy your shares, in practice they are worth $0.00.
 - Most startups fail, so the median startup's equity ends up being worth $0.00.
