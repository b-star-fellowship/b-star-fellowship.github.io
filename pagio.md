# [Pagio (2025)](https://pagio.app)

## Sam: How are you launching and acquiring users?
Jerry: We’re onboarding 7–8 schools, right now (we just had a call, and have another call right after this). Fun story; our first launch was during YC Startup School.  We were staying at a hostel and didn't realize that it was a federal holiday since neither of us are US citizens and we didn't realize that there's a one-day federal holiday.  So we launched into a federal holiday and we didn't understand why nobody was clicking any of our emails. We got zero clicks on all of our emails and we're like, "Wait, what's going on?" And we're like, "Okay, all the teachers are not at school."

Adithya: We push major updates weekly, like adding book previews. Current stats: ~5 daily active users, 10–12 weekly, 20 monthly. Mostly middle schoolers ages 8–12 from middle to upper-middle-class families. We recruited via teacher interviews, Brown faculty, posters, and school partnerships.  

## Sam: Which features are most popular?
Jerry: Daily articles are the biggest driver of engagement—we raised the limit from one to five. Multiple-choice quizzes are also surprisingly popular; some kids do them for hours to earn points.  
Adithya: We thought voice chat would be big, but it wasn’t. Text chat is preferred.  

## Sam: How do features differ in cost?
Adithya: Text features like quizzes, chats, and articles are cheapest. Voice chat is most expensive, followed by comics. Average cost is 4.5–5¢ per session (8¢ with audio). With rewards, total cost is ~$2.50 per user per month.  

## Sam: Any strategies to lower costs?
Jerry: Schools often want to run their own reward systems, like pizza parties or tokens, using our leaderboard. That reduces costs. We’re also building peer challenges—students can “battle” each other with questions—and a review platform so kids can recommend books to each other.  

## Sam: How do you split the work?
Adithya: I build the system and core code. Jerry focuses on prompt engineering, onboarding, outreach, and testing. We collaborate on outreach and decks.  
Jerry: Yeah Adi builds the framework, I refine prompts.  

## Sam: What surprised you most this summer?
Adithya: That kids didn’t like voice chat, but loved text chat.  
Jerry: That multiple-choice quizzes are incredibly popular, even among strong readers. Our most active users rarely redeem their gems—they just want points.  

## Sam: Favorite part of startup life?
Jerry: Favorite: building something useful and hearing enthusiasm from teachers and parents.
Adithya: Definitely seeing users returning daily is the best part.

## Sam: Any advice for student founders?
Jerry: Focus on solving problems for a small group you deeply understand—five users is enough to start. Know whether you’re serious or treating it as a side project.  
Adithya: Expect rejection and failure. Keep iterating until product-market fit. Selling is critical—get out of your comfort zone and pitch directly.  

## Sam: Any favorite failure stories?
Jerry: An investor questioned whether parents actually want kids to read. We had no data ready and the call went badly. We later realized they wanted proof of market size, they weren't actually insinuating that parents don’t care. 

## Sam: If you ran this program, what would you do differently?
Adithya: Push students to focus on sales, not just building. Selling teaches you if people want your product and builds resilience.  
Jerry: Increase call frequency—positive calls kept us motivated early. Grants could also be distributed step by step, since you don’t need much money to get your first users.  
Sam: So, “cheerleader functionality”—encouragement and structured check-ins.  
Jerry: Exactly. Even a nudge like when you sent us the article about “Gen Z isn’t reading to their kids" helps spark ideas.
