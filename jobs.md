# Startup Software Engineering Job Guide
### October 2024

Warning: Following these instructions will take considerable time and energy (2+ months of consistent effort).  IMO that is a worthwhile investment to get a job you find meaningful.  

_Any italicized text is anecdotal/my own experience, and should not be considered representative of all startups._

## Time Management
If you're like me, you'll find all this work draining and miserable at first.  Here's some tips to speed up & feel better:

 - Use the [Pomodoro method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) for focus, and dedicate 2-3 hours at a time to submitting applications.

 - Give yourself a little treat, but only after finishing a session (grandma's rule).

 - Put your phone in another room while you're doing these, no multitasking allowed.

## Preparation
### 1. Your Resume (3-5 hours)
 - Make one primary copy of your resume, either in a plain text file or in a template like [this one](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-pragmatic-engineers-resume-template/).  This primary copy should be as detailed and long as possible; include everything you've done that could possibly relate to a software engineering job or ML job.  Don't worry about limiting to 1 page.

 - Keep it simple with 3 sections: **Experience, Education,** and **Languages & Tools** (in that order)

 - I would put all of your actual work experience as the first entries under Experience, and any big projects from your coursework or before Brown as their own entries after that.

 - As much as you can, include meaningful metrics about how you contributed to your jobs & projects.  How much money/how many hours did your work save the organization?  How many people did your feature affect?  Businesses like stuff like that if you make it sound impressive.

 - Under Education, add Brown University & write all of your CS classes.

 - Under Technologies & Languages add the programming languages, technologies (like Git, AWS, any special command line stuff, etc.) & frameworks (like Rails, React, PyTorch) you've used in your classes and projects and feel comfortable with.   These will be important keywords for Recruiters, application reviewers, and AIs.

 - Make sure that you have a LinkedIn account, and it contains all the information you're putting into the primary resume.  Ideally with a professional headshot.


### 2. Practicing for interviews (3-5 weeks)
  - You want to make sure your programming fundamentals are sound, which means reviewing a lot of material from the intro CS classes:
      - Data Structures: Hash Tables, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Tries, Graphs, Vectors, Heaps.
      - Algorithms: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, BreadthFirst Search, Depth-First Search.
      - Concepts: Big-O Time, Big-O Space, Recursion & Memoization, Probability.

  - When I was interviewing, this meant going through the first 4 chapters of [cracking the coding interview](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-pragmatic-engineers-resume-template/).  Nowadays you might find a structured set of exercises on Leetcode or a diff online coding website.

  - Ideally you would dedicate at least 2 weeks to reviewing these, it'll make you feel a lot more confident in any first round technical interviews.  Hard to do mid semester, so def try to do it over winter break.

  - If you're interested in a specialty (distributed systems, machine learning, design), defniitely investigate other interview prep for those specialties.  For example, in ML that might include implementing a gradient descent algorithm, a classifier over MNIST, etc.

## Sourcing Companies (1-3 days)
 - First, make a Companies google sheet with the following columns
    - **Company Name**
    - **Priority (High or Low)**
    - **Link (To specific job listing, or a careers/jobs page)**
    - **Things I like (Notes for yourself about the company)**
    - Contact (emails, or links to a linkedin profile of ppl at the company who seem related to the role)
    - Reading material (link to blog or articles)
    - Questions for interviewer

 - Throughout your search, if you find a company you're interested in, you add it to this list.

 - ```val priority = if (youLikeCompany) HIGH else LOW```

 - Dedicate at least a day just to sourcing mode; you're just looking for jobs to apply to and filling out the columns that are bolded.  Don't actually apply to anything while you're in sourcing mode.

 - For HIGH priority companies / jobs, make sure to write a few bullet points about what's interesting about the company.

 - A good first place to look for startup jobs are VC job boards. Here's some examples that are worth pouring over, note that they'll probably overlap with each other:
	 - [https://www.workatastartup.com/](https://www.workatastartup.com/)
	 - [https://jobs.a16z.com/jobs](https://jobs.a16z.com/jobs)
	 - [https://jobs.sequoiacap.com/jobs/](https://jobs.sequoiacap.com/jobs/)
	 - [https://www.indexventures.com/startup-jobs](https://www.indexventures.com/startup-jobs)
	 - [https://jobs.thrivecap.com/companies](https://jobs.thrivecap.com/companies)
	 - [https://jobs.bvp.com/](https://jobs.bvp.com/)
	 - [https://jobs.techstars.com/jobs](https://jobs.techstars.com/jobs)
 - Look at every app on your phone & laptop that you actually use, then go search the jobs pages for that company.  For me that's Duolingo, Eight Sleep, Chess.com, Spotify & YouTube.  These may not technically be startups

 - AI companies have a lot of money right now, so look for lists of emerging AI companies [like this one](https://a16z.com/100-gen-ai-apps/) and search those companies' websites.

 - Look up all of the career fair events at Brown, find all those companies, and add them to your sheet before the actual career fair.

 - More companies in the list is always better, but you should aim to have at least 5 high priority companies, and at least 10 low priority companies.

## Applying
### 1. Gameplan

 - Assuming you're prepared and have a big list of companies, you're ready to start applying.  

 - Interviewing is like a sport; you want to make sure you're warmed up before the games that matter; pick a first batch of 3-5 companies that are low priority which will be your first companies to apply to.

 - Then, pick a second batch of companies that includes 1 or 2 of your high priority companies (and some low priority ones), which you'll apply to 1 week later.

### 2.  For Each Application (30 mins each):
 - Create a version of your resume tailored specifically to the job application.  That means:
    - Expand on the most relevant experience, education & language/tools for that job.  Filter out unrelated stuff.
    - As much as possible, include language from the job posting in your tailored resume without being dishonest.
    - If you trust Chat GPT, you can paste the job description & your full resume into Chat GPT and ask it to do the first draft for you.
    - The tailored resume should be one page long, and put into a template [like this one](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-pragmatic-engineers-resume-template/).

 - Take up to 10 minutes to search the company's website & linkedin for any long form writing they have about engineering or product.  This is a great source of questions for you to ask an interviewer, which will show you're actually interested in the company's work - fill your questions in your google sheet.

 - Also take up to 10 minutes to search LinkedIn for people who have similar roles to the job application, or seem related to the actual hiring process (recruiters, HR, CEO/founders sometimes).  Save any of their profile links in your google sheet.

 - Some jobs require a cover letter, or for you to fill out some extra information for why you're interested in their company specifically.  This is a great place to use stuff from your Things I like column or your questions column.  If they ask for a cover letter, keep it concise, tone should be eager and appreciative of their time, and don't be afraid to get creative.

 - _When I was interviewing regularly for engineering positions at Down Dog, a few people stood out by putting jokes in applications, and it made me want to talk to them more.  With other companies, your mileage may vary._

 - Submit your tailored resume, cover letter, and extra information!  **Guess what you're not done yet!**

 - Put a reminder in your calendar for 3 business days from now to LinkedIn message everyone you added to the Contact column.  You should send them something to the effect of:
   - "Hey there [USE THEIR NAME]!  My name is [YOUR NAME], I recently applied for the [XXX JOB], and am super excited about [COMPANY YYY].  I would love to ask you a couple questions about your role/company: [INSERT YOUR GOOD, THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS HERE]?  Thanks so much for your time!"
   - If you can get their email from their linkedin profile, send them the same stuff in an email too, but change up the text slightly so it doesn't feel spammy.
   - [Here is some supplemental advice for cold emailing people](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsOCE/comments/1acm703/my_guide_to_cold_emailingpitching_to_companies/)

 - Make sure to write what you're going to send to people ahead of time, so that it's just copy and pasting when you actually message them.  It'll also help you catch when you inevitably copy and paste the wrong name in a message to someone (not good).

 - Put a reminder in your calendar for 7 business days from now to double text anyone that didn't respond to your first messages.

 - Expect a response rate of about 4%; that means for every 25 of these messages you send, you'll get 1 response.  That means especially for high priority companies, you want to reach out to as many relevant people as possible.

### 3. Batching tips
 - Try to group the jobs with similar titles or companies together, their tailored resumes will be similar (which will let you copy and paste more).

 - Again, give yourself a tasty treat once you deserve it.

## Interviewing
 - If you know who your interviewer's name ahead of time, read their LinkedIn and come up with more questions specifically for them in the interview.  Not just questions about the job details like pay/vacation/401k, but questions about the product or their personal experience with the company.

 - _When I was interviewing people and they had no questions afterwards, that was a red flag.  I want to hire people who are not just technically competant, but curious and excited about my work._  

 - Make sure you get enough sleep and have eaten a meal 1-2 hours before your interview.  Solving technical problems while you're hungry is like mirror mode in mario kart. Go to the bathroom beforehand too.

 - Don't be late.

 - After the interview, send an email to the interviewer thanking them for the time.  If you have any supplemental questions include those too.  Ask when you should expect to hear from them, and if they don't answer, put a reminder in your calendar to follow up with them in 1 week.

 - If you think you bombed the interview, be nice to yourself and keep applying elsewhere.  That's why we do practice interviews!

 - If you think you rocked the interview, give yourself a pat on the back and keep applying elsewhere.  _Don't be like me, who thought he aced his Google & Facebook onsite interviews, then confidently stopped applying elsewhere, only to get rejected by both 2 weeks later._

 - Generally, try to respond to recruiters / employees running the interview process within a few hours to show you're interested.  Keep your calendar up to date with all your interviews.

## Understanding Equity
 - When you get an offer, your compensation will usually have 3 parts:  Salary, Equity, and Benefits.

 - Equity is ownership (either shares or stock options) in the company.

 - Startups want their employees to own pieces of the company, so that employees are rewarded for their work & the company growing.

 - Below are two real world examples from my own career to illustrate how you can value equity as part of your job offer.

### _Example 1: My 2017 Down Dog offer (shares):_
 - $100,000 yearly salary
 - 106,000 shares in the company, vesting over 4 years
 - Health insurance, food paid for at work

### 1. How much were 106,000 shares of Down Dog worth?
 - To compute this, we need to know A) how many shares are outstanding, and B) the current valuation of the company.
 - At the time of the offer, there were 5,088,000 shares outstanding, owned by other employees at the company.
 - At the time of the offer, the company valued themselves at $5,000,000 (with an implied price per share of $0.9827)

 - If I were issued 106,000 shares, my shares would amount to `106,000 / (106,000 + 5,088,000) => 0.02040816326`, or roughly 2% of the company.
 - 2% of a company valued at $5,000,000 equates to roughly $100,000.

### 2.  What is vesting?
 - Imagine I accepted the offer, immediately owned my 2% of the company, and then quit after a month.  That would be a disaster for Down Dog; they spent the equivalent of ~$100,000 for one month of work.

 - "Vesting" means those 106,000 shares are earned over time.  Vesting over 4 years means earning `106,000 / 4 => 26,500` shares per year.

 - Vesting schedules usually have a "1 year cliff": meaning I only earned my 26,500 shares after working at the company for a year, and after that start earning them normally.

 - A cliff protects the startup in the case where they hire an employee who doesn't work out, and the relationship sours.

### 3.  What's the total compensation?
 - 26,500 shares comes out to roughly $26,000 per year in ownership of the company
 - Having meals paid for while at the office meant I was saving about ~$30 per work day, so `52 * 5 * 30 => $7,800` per year for food.
 - Salary + equity + food costs comes out to roughly $133,800 as total compensation.

### Options vs Shares
 - When you earn shares, you have to pay taxes on them just like your salary.  That's not a big problem for early stage companies, which the government values close to $0.  

 - For later stage startups this is problematic, since they want employees to be incentivized by the company growing, but don't want to give their employees big tax burdens.

 - One solution is to issue options instead of shares.  An option is a contract that will let you buy shares at a pre-described price.

 - While they help you defer taxes, stock options can be slightly more complicated to value.

### _Example 2: My 2021 Down Dog equity refresher (stock options):_
 - As incentive to stay around longer, Down Dog offered me 46,370 stock options, vesting over another 4 years.
 - At the time of the offer, there were 5,495,506 shares outstanding, owned by employees at the company.
 - At the time of the offer, the company valued itself at $12,000,000 (with an implied price per share of $2.18)
 - That $2.18 is the exercise price of the options; once fully vested, I have the option to buy 46,370 shares in the company for `$2.18 * 46,370 => $101,086.60`

### 1. How much are those 46,370 stock options worth?
 - It depends on the price per share when you want to sell the shares.
 - Imagine Down Dog goes public, and the price per share is $4.00.  I could exercise the options for $2.18 and immediately sell the shares for $4 each to the public.
 - In that example, the options themselves are worth `($4.00 - $2.18) * 46,370 => $84,393.4`
 - Note: If the price per share goes below $2.18, the options are worthless.

### 2. What are shares/options worth if Down Dog doesn't go public?
 - A stock is worth what someone will pay you for it.  So if nobody can buy your shares, in practice they are worth $0.00.
 - Most startups fail, so the median startup's equity ends up being worth $0.00.

### 3. How do I properly value equity in job offers?

### 4. More reading:
 - Here are some good references to deep dive into understanding equity.
   - [Equity for employees](https://stripe.com/guides/equity-for-employees)
   - [Equity Guide for Employees at Fast-growing Companies](https://manual.compoundplanning.com/equity-guide-for-employees-at-fast-growing-companies?collection=early-employee)

## Navigating offers
### 1. Immediately upon receiving an offer from company [XXX]
 - For each HIGH priority company [YYY] that you're already in the pipeline for, email the person you've been corresponding with saying something like "Hey there!  I just want to let you know that I've received an attractive job offer from another company.  I'm still really excited about [YYY] and if possible would love to continue the process to see if we're a good fit."

 - Apply to the remaining HIGH priority companies that you would prefer to company [XXX], to get started within their processes ASAP.

 - 

### 2. Evaluating offers (with example)
 - Your offer will have 3 parts:  Salary, Equity, and Benefits.  Equity is ownership in the company, but requires a little math to properly value.

 - Example:  You received the following offer from an exciting new software startup Brown Bog.  It's

### 3. Negotiating
 - Unfortunately, at many companies your starting salary is determined more by how well you negotiate than your merit or expected contribution.  So it's in your best interest to negotiate, even if that feels uncomfortable.

 - **The best negotiation strategy is to have a competing offer**

 - Learn the current general salary ranges for your position.  Here's some resources to search for the ranges you can expect:
   - [SF Bay Startup Salaries](https://wellfound.com/hiring-data/l/san-francisco-bay-area)
   - [Real time software eng salary benchmark](https://www.levels.fyi/benchmark)
   - Also, check the Brown CS self reported internship & salary spreadsheet, which will give you a range for engineers with your background.

 - 

### 3.  Staying Grounded
 - Say the following out loud to yourself in the mirror: "This offer might go away".  _I know several people who received offers from a company, accepted, only for the companies to revoke the offer months later due to layoffs, budget cuts, etc._
