## Wordgolf - Eric Xia:
We were thinking about using AI to generate images for the different words in our game to make the creative path-finding aspect more visual and sharable. My co-founder wasn't a fan, and I also started having second thoughts about quality control and how our user base, who seems to be anti-AI, would react to it.

## Sam:
At Down Dog, we experimented with using generative AI for our meditations. The goal was to have a calm, pleasing visual that wasn't too in-your-face. While it didn't seem to hurt our metrics like retention or practice completion, we definitely got more negative feedback on that than on other features.

The nice thing for us was that we had a fixed number of meditations, so we could quality-check the visuals. With your game, you have a combinatorial explosion of possible paths, meaning you'd be generating images every time. You wouldn't be able to QA the full set of things that users are seeing, so you can't guarantee the quality. I'd probably put that idea on the back burner for now.

## Wordgolf - Eric Xia:
We've got about 50 daily active users and we're debating our next move. Should we focus on improving and iterating on Wordgolf, or should we start building out other games to create an ecosystem? A new game might bring in more users, but I'm also worried about spreading our resources too thin.

## Sam:
This is the exact dilemma we faced at Down Dog. The vision was always to take a small set of media and reuse it to create as much fitness content as possible, across yoga, HIIT, barre, all of it.

But we started with yoga to prove out the idea. The app launched in the fall of 2015, but we didn't officially start working on new fitness types like HIIT and barre until 2019. It took us four years of focusing just on the yoga product. In that time, we were constantly iterating and building out the core infrastructure, which ended up being useful for the other apps later on. If we had tried to start building HIIT and barre back in 2017, I suspect it would have been a huge mistake. We likely wouldn't have launched a bunch of important features within the main yoga app in time for New Year's resolutions season. There's an art to figuring out when to expand your core offering, and for us, iterating on the flagship product first was the right call.

## Wordgolf - Eric Xia:
We're thinking about how to best communicate with our users. I was worried that emailing them too often, like every time we ship a small new feature, would come off as desperate. We're trying to figure out when it's appropriate to reach out.

## Sam:
Don't underestimate the personal touch, even at scale. We ran an experiment last year at Down Dog. We set up a system to automatically email every user who turned off their subscription's auto-renewal. The email came directly from our founder, Carlos, and said something like, "Hey, I'm Carlos, the founder of Down Dog. I noticed you turned your subscription off and was wondering if there was anything we could do to keep your business. We'd love to hear from you."

The replies went straight to his inbox, so he was reading probably 20 of these a day. From that feedback, we found two small things we could change that kept a couple of people. Mostly, people said they couldn't afford it, so we just gave them free access. We haven't finished the experiment, but I suspect we'll probably retain 10-15% of those people in the long run. It was incredibly useful.

So, maybe don't email about every little tweak. But for a big new feature? Or if a user was playing every day for a week and then suddenly stopped? A personal email asking what happened can be really powerful. You don't have to sound desperate, just say, "Hey, we saw you were really engaged and now you're not. Did anything change? We'd love to hear your thoughts." People are busy; you have to reach out if you want them to re-engage.
