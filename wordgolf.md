# [Word Golf (2025)](https://word.golf)
### [Eric Xia](https://eric-xia.com/) & [Julian Beaudry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-beaudry-05229b232/)

word.golf is an online sport played with pretrained word embeddings. There are five rounds: in each, a source and target word with low cosine similarity are used. Word golf is played by finding the closest word out of a 4 by 7 grid: for instance, danger -> fragile -> falter -> linger is one path, which intuits ‘fragile’ is a bridge word between the source and target. When the target shows up in the nearest neighbors, it is made easily visible to avoid frustrating the user. As a nod to the ‘golf’ aspect, there is always a two-click path from the source to the target.

### Sam: When did you last launch, and what new features did you add?
Eric: We released major versions in June and July, adding persistent history, account functionality, and UI improvements.
Julian: In July and early August, we added a catalog to replay past days and a race feature to compete with friends.

### Sam: How did you distribute those updates?
Julian: At first we just told friends and played races with them. Existing users noticed the new “race” button at the top of the screen and started trying it.

### Sam: How many active users do you have now?
Eric: About 30 daily active users, 200 weekly, and 500 over the past month.

### Sam: Are most users strangers or friends?
Julian: Most daily players are strangers—at least two-thirds. Some accounts are anonymous, so it’s hard to get exact numbers.

### Sam: What does it cost to run Word Golf?
Julian: About one dollar a day for the app and database, both hosted on Digital Ocean. We’re far from capacity, so we can support many more users.

### Sam: What are you working on next?
Julian: I’m building a prompt maker and revising the UI to make it less intimidating for new users.
Eric: I’m experimenting with a new game using sentence embeddings, aiming to create enriching online experiences based on shared language knowledge.

### Sam: How do you split the work?
Julian: Eric did a lot of the front-end. I handled authentication and back-end. I built the catalog; Eric built the race feature.

### Sam: What product lessons surprised you?
Eric: Directly reaching out to people with established user bases, with specific interests works better than passive advertising like posters.

Julian: We cut features like a skip button and a back button. They cluttered the UI, and we already had automatic skip after 12 jumps. We also had to completely rework the tutorial after testing with new players.

### Sam: What’s been your favorite and least favorite part of the startup?
Eric: Favorite: seeing direct impact of my work on users. Least favorite: spending time on features that never ship.

Julian: My favorite moment was waking up to 100 new players overnight after the comic creator mentioned us. It’s rewarding to see people enjoy what we built.

### Sam: What advice would you give other Brown students building products?
Eric: Be clear on why you’re building something and who it’s for. With Word Golf, I built it out of personal fascination with language vectors, but broader appeal is trickier.

Julian: Talk to users constantly. Quick feedback has been invaluable for us.

### Sam: What could improve the summer program?
Eric: More interaction between different groups of fellows, to learn from each other’s struggles—especially on entrepreneurship.

Julian: Regular demo sessions, maybe monthly, so everyone can share progress and challenges. It would build a stronger community.
