# Finding a job at a startup 
### (Last updated Oct 2024)

Warning; Doing all this will take a lot of time and energy.  IMO that is a worthwhile investment to get an engaging job you actually like.  Any highlighted text is are anecdotal/my own experience, and should not be considered representative of all startups.


## Preparation
### 1. Your Resume
 - Make one master copy of your resume, either in a plain text file or in a template like this one.  This master copy should be as detailed and long as possible; include everything you've done that could possibly relate to a software engineering job or ML job.  Don't worry about limiting to 1 page.

 - Keep it simple with 3 sections: Experience, Education, and Languages & Tools (in that order)

 - I would put all of your actual work experience (Brown University, B* Fellowship) as the first entries under Experience, and any big projects from your coursework or before Brown as their own entries after that.

 - As much as you can, include meaningful metrics about how you contributed to your jobs & projects.  How much money/how many hours did your work save the organization?  How many people did your feature affect?  Businesses like stuff like that if you make it sound impressive.

 - Under Education, add Brown University & write all of your CS classes, don't include high school.

 - Under Technologies & Languages add the programming languages, technologies (like Git, AWS, any special command line stuff, etc.) & frameworks (like Rails, React, PyTorch) you've used in your classes and projects and feel comfortable with.   Recruiters, application reviewers, and AIs will scan for these keywords so the more the better.

 - Make sure that you have a LinkedIn account, and it contains all the information you're putting into the master resume.  Ideally with a professional headshot.

 ### 2. Practicing for interviews
  - You want to make sure your programming fundamentals are sound, which means reviewing a lot of material from the intro CS classes:
      - Data Structures: Hash Tables, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Tries, Graphs, Vectors, Heaps.
      - Algorithms: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, BreadthFirst Search, Depth-First Search.
      - Concepts: Big-O Time, Big-O Space, Recursion & Memoization, Probability, Bit Manipulation.

  - When I was interviewing, this meant going through the first 4 chapters of cracking the coding interview.  Nowadays you might find a structured set of exercises on Leetcode or a diff online coding website.

  - Ideally you would dedicate at least 2 weeks to reviewing these, it'll make you feel a lot more confident in any first round technical interviews.  Hard to do mid semester, so def try to do it over winter break.

  - If you're interested in a specialty (distributed systems, machine learning), defniitely investigate interview prep for those specialties.  For example, in ML that might include gradient descent, implementing a classifier over MNIST, etc.

## Sourcing Companies
 - First, make a Companies google sheet with the following columns
     - Company Name
	 - Priority (High or Low)
	 - Link (To specific job listing, or a careers/jobs page)
	 - Things I like (Notes for yourself about the company)
	 - Contact (emails, or links to a linkedin profile of ppl at the company who seem related to the role)
	 - Reading material (link to blog or articles)
	 - Questions for interviewer
 - Throughout your search, if you find a company that is (Hiring || a company you like), you add it to this list.

 - Priority = if (you really like the company) HIGH else LOW
 - Dedicate at least a day just to sourcing mode; you're just looking for jobs to apply to and filling out the columns that are highlighted in blue.  Don't actually apply to anything while you're in sourcing mode.

 - For HIGH priority companies / jobs, make sure to write a few bullet points about what's interesting about the company.

 - A good first place to look for startup jobs are VC job boards. Here's some examples that are worth pouring over, note that they'll probably overlap with each other:
	 - https://www.workatastartup.com/
	 - https://jobs.a16z.com/jobs
	 - https://jobs.sequoiacap.com/jobs/
	 - https://www.indexventures.com/startup-jobs
	 - https://jobs.thrivecap.com/companies
	 - https://jobs.bvp.com/
	 - https://jobs.techstars.com/jobs
 - Look at every app on your phone & laptop that you actually use, then go search the jobs pages for that company.  For me that's Duolingo, Eight Sleep, Chess.com, Spotify & YouTube.
 - AI companies have a lot of money right now, so look for lists of emerging AI companies (like this one) and search those companies' websites.
 - Look up all of the career fair events at Brown, find all those companies, and add them to your sheet before the actual career fair.
 - More companies in the list is always better, but you should aim to have at least 5 high priority companies, and at least 10 low priority companies.
